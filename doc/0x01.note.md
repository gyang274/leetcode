## catalan number

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number

In combinatorial mathematics, the Catalan numbers form a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, often involving recursively defined objects. They are named after the Belgian mathematician Eugene Charles Catalan (1814â€“1894).

The nth Catalan number is given directly in terms of binomial coefficients by
c_n = math.comb(2n, n)/ (n + 1) = math.factorial(2n) / (math.factorial(n + 1) * math.factorial(n)) = \prod_{k=2}^{n} ((n + k) / k), n >= 0

The first Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, 16796, 58786, ..

The Catalan numbers satisfy the recurrence relations:
c_0 = 1, c_{n+1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} c_i*c_{n - i} = 2(2n + 1) / (n + 2) * c_n, n >= 0

Asymptotically, the Catalan numbers grow as Cn ~ 4^{n} / (n^{3/2} * \sqrt(\pi)), in the sense that the quotient of the nth Catalan number and the expression on the right tends towards 1 as n approaches infinity. This can be proved by using Stirling's approximation for n! or via generating functions.

Applications:
- Cn is the number of Dyck words of length 2n. A Dyck word is a string consisting of n X's and n Y's such that no initial segment of the string has more Y's than X's, e.g., XYXXYY.
- Cn counts the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched, X -> (, Y -> ).
- Cn is the number of different ways n + 1 factors can be completely parenthesized (or the number of ways of associating n applications of a binary operator)
- Successive applications of a binary operator can be represented in terms of a full binary tree.
- Cn is the number of non-isomorphic ordered (or plane) trees with n + 1 vertices.
- Cn is the number of monotonic lattice paths along the edges of a grid with n Ã— n square cells, which do not pass above the diagonal. A monotonic path is one which starts in the lower left corner, finishes in the upper right corner, and consists entirely of edges pointing rightwards or upwards. Counting such paths is equivalent to counting Dyck words: X stands for "move right" and Y stands for "move up".
- A convex polygon with n + 2 sides can be cut into triangles by connecting vertices with non-crossing line segments (a form of polygon triangulation). The number of triangles formed is n and the number of different ways that this can be achieved is Cn.
- Cn is the number of stack-sortable permutations of {1, ..., n}. A permutation w is called stack-sortable if S(w) = (1, ..., n), where S(w) is defined recursively as follows: write w = unv where n is the largest element in w and u and v are shorter sequences, and set S(w) = S(u)S(v)n, with S being the identity for one-element sequences.
- Cn is the number of permutations of {1, ..., n} that avoid the permutation pattern 123 (or, alternatively, any of the other patterns of length 3); that is, the number of permutations with no three-term increasing subsequence. For n = 3, these permutations are 132, 213, 231, 312 and 321. For n = 4, they are 1432, 2143, 2413, 2431, 3142, 3214, 3241, 3412, 3421, 4132, 4213, 4231, 4312 and 4321.
- Cn is the number of noncrossing partitions of the set {1, ..., n}. A fortiori, Cn never exceeds the nth Bell number. Cn is also the number of noncrossing partitions of the set {1, ..., 2n} in which every block is of size 2. The conjunction of these two facts may be used in a proof by mathematical induction that all of the free cumulants of degree more than 2 of the Wigner semicircle law are zero. This law is important in free probability theory and the theory of random matrices.
- Cn is the number of ways to tile a stairstep shape of height n with n rectangles.
- Cn is the number of ways to form a "mountain range" with n upstrokes and n downstrokes that all stay above a horizontal line. The mountain range interpretation is that the mountains will never go below the horizon.
- Cn is the number of standard Young tableaux whose diagram is a 2-by-n rectangle. In other words, it is the number of ways the numbers 1, 2, ..., 2n can be arranged in a 2-by-n rectangle so that each row and each column is increasing. As such, the formula can be derived as a special case of the hook-length formula.
- Cn is the number of ways that the vertices of a convex 2n-gon can be paired so that the line segments joining paired vertices do not intersect. This is precisely the condition that guarantees that the paired edges can be identified (sewn together) to form a closed surface of genus zero (a topological 2-sphere).
- Cn is the number of semiorders on n unlabeled items.
- In chemical engineering Cnâˆ’1 is the number of possible separation sequences which can separate a mixture of n components.

### submask enumeration

https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/all-submasks.html

Given a bitmask m, you want to efficiently iterate through all of its submasks, that is, masks s in which only bits that were included in mask m are set.

Consider the implementation of this algorithm, based on tricks with bit operations:
```
for (int s=m; s; s=(s-1)&m)
 ... you can use s ...
```
Let us examine why the above code visits all submasks of m, without repetition, and in descending order.


In many problems, especially those that use bitmask dynamic programming, you want to iterate through all bitmasks and for each mask, iterate through all of its submasks:
```
for (int m=0; m<(1<<n); ++m)
    for (int s=m; s; s=(s-1)&m)
 ... s and m ...
```
Let's prove that the inner loop will execute a total of O(3^n) iterations.
