### submask enumeration

https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/all-submasks.html

Given a bitmask m, you want to efficiently iterate through all of its submasks, that is, masks s in which only bits that were included in mask m are set.

Consider the implementation of this algorithm, based on tricks with bit operations:
```
for (int s=m; s; s=(s-1)&m)
 ... you can use s ...
```
Let us examine why the above code visits all submasks of m, without repetition, and in descending order.


In many problems, especially those that use bitmask dynamic programming, you want to iterate through all bitmasks and for each mask, iterate through all of its submasks:
```
for (int m=0; m<(1<<n); ++m)
    for (int s=m; s; s=(s-1)&m)
 ... s and m ...
```
Let's prove that the inner loop will execute a total of O(3^n) iterations.
